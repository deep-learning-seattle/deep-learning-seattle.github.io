# How to prepare exercise for peer review
We do peer review in Seatle meetup. The ODS guys do not do it as far as i know.

Fork [our repo](https://github.com/deep-learning-seattle/cs231n-assignment_1.git).

Do your homework and pass your repo link to your peer.

# Peer review process

TBD

# Kick off meetings (12/20/2018 and 12/27/2018) summary
* We use the Spring 2017 syllabus http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/
* Please ignore my idea on using Google Colab. Unfortunatelly it's not easy to get access to the files from the Colab notebook.
* I propose local or cloud setup with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* How to start with Python [HackerRank Python domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python), [Stanford's tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
* Open Data Science Slack [how to join](https://www.meetup.com/deep-learning-seattle/events/xpphnqyxqbbc/)
* Networking spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mmjcplwDRoXwKNlXQ5GKQuw-ig0Wwz8RiD9ZgXRikPU/edit#gid=0).

## What to do during Week 1
1. Setup your environment. Authors claim that we can avoid using GPU. I doubt but I'll try 
2. Fork https://github.com/deep-learning-seattle/cs231n-assignment_1.git and clone your copy to your environment
3. Watch Lecture #1 and #2.
4. Read lecture notes - there are a lot of information there
5. Complete following assignments: [knn](https://github.com/deep-learning-seattle/cs231n-assignment_1/blob/master/knn.ipynb) and [softmax](https://github.com/deep-learning-seattle/cs231n-assignment_1/blob/master/softmax.ipynb)
